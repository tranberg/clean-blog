Clean Blog
==========

**Clean Blog** is a minimalist Bootstrap theme originally made by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/), which has now been adapted for [Nibbleblog](https://github.com/dignajar/nibbleblog).

So far the only supported Nibbleblog plugin is Pages. There is no support for comments, tags, and categories.

Have a look at the [original license](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE).
